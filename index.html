							Black moves first. The players alternate thereafter.
						</li>
						<li>
							When it is their turn, a player may either pass (by announcing "pass" and performing no action) or play. A play consists of the following steps: 
							<ol>
								<li>
									Placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection
								</li>
								<li>
									Removing from the board any stones of their opponent's color that have no liberties.
								</li>
								<li>
									Removing from the board any stones of their own color that have no liberties.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							A play is illegal if it would have the effect (after all steps of the play have been completed) of creating a position that has occurred previously in the game.
						</li>
						<li>
							The game ends when both players have passed consecutively. The final position is the position on the board at the time the players pass consecutively. 
						</li>
